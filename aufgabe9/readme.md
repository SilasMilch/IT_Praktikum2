It seems like you're working through a detailed tutorial or set of instructions for creating a GUI application using Qt, specifically for implementing a street planner with features like adding cities, drawing them on a map, and eventually adding functionalities like finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. Let's break down the instructions and provide explanations where needed.
Overview

The task involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) application in Qt to manage cities and streets on a map. You'll be utilizing Qt Designer for designing the main window layout and incorporating various Qt classes and functions to achieve the desired functionality.
Detailed Steps and Explanations

    Creating GUI Elements
        Use Qt Designer (mainwindow.ui) to design the main window layout.
        Add elements like labels (Label), line edits (LineEdit), push buttons (PushButton), and a graphics view (Graphics View).
        Arrange these elements in a grid layout to manage their placement.

    Configuring GUI Elements
        Customize properties of GUI elements like labels, line edits, and push buttons using Qt Designer.
        Assign meaningful names (objectName) to each element which will be used to reference them in code (label_eingabe, lineEdit_teste_was, etc.).
        Set properties like text, placeholderText, clearButtonEnabled, and toolTip to enhance usability and functionality.

    Preview and Testing
        Use Alt-Shift-R to preview the window without compiling, ensuring it looks and behaves correctly.
        Test resizing of the window and check the layout adjustments.

    Connecting Signals and Slots
        Use Qt Designer to connect signals like clicked() of PushButton to slots where actions are defined.
        Example: Output messages using qDebug() when a button is clicked to verify functionality (clicked() signal).

    Implementing Drawing on Graphics View
        Introduce QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsView to facilitate graphical representation of cities and streets.
        Implement methods to draw cities (City class) as points on the scene.
        Use QGraphicsItem for custom drawing and interaction.

    Adding Menu Bar
        Enhance the GUI with a menu bar (File, Open, Save, Exit, etc.) using Qt Designer.
        Implement functionality for menu items like saving and exiting (exit() function).
        Add shortcuts (Alt+E for Exit) to improve usability.

    Creating Data Structures
        Define classes like City and Street to represent cities and streets.
        Implement methods in these classes for drawing themselves on the QGraphicsScene.

    Implementing a Map Class
        Introduce a Map class to manage cities and streets.
        Utilize Qt container classes for managing collections of cities.
        Implement methods to add cities (addCity()), draw them, and manage streets.

    Expanding Functionality
        Integrate more features like adding streets (addStreet()), validating city connections before adding streets.
        Utilize inheritance (AbstractMap) for abstraction and modularity.

    User Interaction
        Implement dialogs for user interactions such as adding new cities.
        Use Qt's dialog classes (QDialog) to gather user input for city properties (name, coordinates).
        Validate and process user input to create new instances of City.

Conclusion

The tutorial progresses systematically from GUI layout design to implementing core functionalities such as adding cities, drawing them on a map, and extending to managing streets and interactions. Each step is complemented by testing procedures to ensure functionality at each stage of development. Following these steps will lead you to a complete Qt application capable of managing and visualizing a map with cities and streets, preparing you for more advanced features like pathfinding algorithms in future iterations.
